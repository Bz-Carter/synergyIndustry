        SYNERGY INDUSTRY worked alongside its customers during two phases: preparation and intervention on their technical shutdowns.
        During the preparation phase, our facilitator drafted the PDPs and informed the external companies concerned.
        During the shutdown phase, our team of prevention experts worked alongside the companies
        external assistance in supporting compliance with instructions, established operating procedures and risk analyses.

        Environmental Impact Assessment (EIE) is a process that, at the very beginning of planning, identifies and assesses the risks of impacts 
        environmental impacts resulting from a planned project. The EIS identifies measures that can be taken to address environmental effects

        EIA therefore represents a proactive and preventive approach to environmental management and protection.
